#### Note from Flic:   
To email everyone in the code group, send an email to "rbgecodegroup@googlegroups.com".  It is currently being used to set up email notifications for commits on Fufluns/RBGE repo, hence why it'll say that in the footer/etc (I can change this if you'd prefer?) but it also allows you to email everyone at once since it's a group mailing list technically.  If you want to subscribe, let me know.  If you're subscribed but don't wish to be, there are details in the footer of an email from the list.  If the volume of emails becomes too much because we're all committing like crazy, let me know and I can tweak it if necessary.

### Software Versions:

Flic is currently using the following (in 64bit Windows 7): 
* Git - v1.9.2
* RStudio - v0.98.507
* R (32bit)- v3.1.0  (needed to change setting in RStudio global options to use 32bit instead of 64bit R)
* Rtools - Rtools31
However I already had most of these installed (except Rtools) so they may not be the versions recommended by the course.

Elspeth is using the following (in 64bit Windows 7):
* 64bit R - v3.0.0 (have not yet seen if Iâ€™ll have the same problem with RStudio - thanks for the tip) I also have 32bit R i386 v3.0.0 (so I guess I may be able to use this?)
* Git - v1.9.0

Robyn is using the following  (in 64bit Windows 7):
* R v3.1.0 - seem to have both 32 and 64 bit available
* RStudio - v0.98.507 (32bit)
* Git 1.9.4

David is using the following  (in Mac 10.7.5):
* R v3.1.1
* RStudio - v0.98.507 (32bit)
* Git 1.9.4
