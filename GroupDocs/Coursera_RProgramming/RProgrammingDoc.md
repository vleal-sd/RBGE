### Software Versions:

Flic is currently using the following (in 64bit Windows 7): 
* Git - v1.9.2
* RStudio - v0.98.507
* R (32bit)- v3.1.0  (needed to change setting in RStudio global options to use 32bit instead of 64bit R)
* Rtools - Rtools31
However I already had most of these installed (except Rtools) so they may not be the versions recommended by the course.

Elspeth is using the following (in 64bit Windows 7):
* 64bit R - v3.0.0 (have not yet seen if I’ll have the same problem with RStudio - thanks for the tip) I also have 32bit R i386 v3.0.0 (so I guess I may be able to use this?)
* Git - v1.9.0

Catherine is using (in Mac 10.9.3, and Linux a bit I hope)
* R 2.13.2
* RStudio - v0.98.507
* Git 1.8.5.2 (Apple Git-48) 
I already hate Git as the push I tried was rejected. (Hi Catherine, see my note below - you probably had the same problem I had, Elspeth)

Robyn is using the following  (in 64bit Windows 7):
* R v3.1.0 - seem to have both 32 and 64 bit available
* RStudio - v0.98.507 (32bit)
* Git 1.9.4

David is using the following  (in 64bit Windows 7):
* R v3.1.0 - seem to have both 32 and 64 bit available
* RStudio - v0.98.507 (32bit)
* Git 1.9.4
