#### Note from Flic:   
To email everyone in the code group, send an email to "rbgecodegroup@googlegroups.com".  It is currently being used to set up email notifications for commits on Fufluns/RBGE repo, hence why it'll say that in the footer/etc (I can change this if you'd prefer?) but it also allows you to email everyone at once since it's a group mailing list technically.  If you want to subscribe, let me know.  If you're subscribed but don't wish to be, there are details in the footer of an email from the list.  If the volume of emails becomes too much because we're all committing like crazy, let me know and I can tweak it if necessary.

**Next meet-up Wednesday 3rd September 2014, 3.15pm, canteen**   
For discussion:
* R Programming debrief
   * General thoughts on the course
   * Anything which would've helped?

### Previous meet-ups: 

*27th August 2014, 3.15pm, canteen*   
Topics:   
* Programming Assignment 2 - evaluation stage
    * Overall no big problems with evaluation stage
* Quiz foibles (qpois function!)
* <<- operator - useful when you need to create an object inside a function then use it outside the function! (thanks @emhaston) 

*20th August, 3.15pm, canteen*   
Topics:
* Upcoming deadlines - what's due when?
   * Programming assignment 2 (peer evaluated, so no late days can be applied!) - DUE Mon 25 Aug 12:30 am (BST)
   * Quiz 3 - DUE Mon 25 Aug 12:30 am (BST)
* Programming Assignment 1 - how did it go?
    * post-event code debrief? ^_^
    * any particularly tricky concepts that we could go over?
* Programming Assignment 2 - has anyone started?  Any tips?
    * submit via github so need to fork the repo & clone to your local machine - is everyone confident with this?
    * will be assessed on whether there's >1 commit, so remember to periodically commit for the marker's sake & yours!
    * 
* Quiz 2 debrief
* Swirl - useful?
* Any progress on the S: drive storage place?
    * Or is the best thing a shared dropbox or similar if it won't be accessible by non-RBGE staff?
    * Any other ideas?
* How are people finding Fufluns shared repo? 
    * is everyone aware of it?  @emhaston?
    * finding pulling/commiting/pushing alright? @redrinkwater & @DavidPurvis
* Any progress on an RBGE repo? :D
* Any cool shares/ R news? 
    * [{cowsay} package!](https://gist.github.com/FlicAnderson/8d57a49e93a240b9060d) - make not very serious ascii fortunes/art for your console & more interesting error messages

    * Storage place on S drive: Training
* ~~Github the R programming Google document~~^DONE
* ~~Flic: Upload the .R quiz 1 answers~~^DONE 
* Gists -Flic to add info about this and how they work since it's helpful for sharing code snippets

### Software Versions:

Flic is currently using the following (in 64bit Windows 7): 
* Git - v1.9.2
* RStudio - v0.98.507
* R (32bit)- v3.1.0  (needed to change setting in RStudio global options to use 32bit instead of 64bit R)
* Rtools - Rtools31
However I already had most of these installed (except Rtools) so they may not be the versions recommended by the course.

Elspeth is using the following (in 64bit Windows 7):
* 64bit R - v3.0.0 (have not yet seen if Iâ€™ll have the same problem with RStudio - thanks for the tip) I also have 32bit R i386 v3.0.0 (so I guess I may be able to use this?)
* Git - v1.9.0

Catherine is using (in Mac 10.9.3, and Linux a bit I hope)
* R 2.13.2
* RStudio - v0.98.507
* Git 1.8.5.2 (Apple Git-48) 
I already hate Git as the push I tried was rejected. (Hi Catherine, see my note below - you probably had the same problem I had, Elspeth)

Robyn is using the following  (in 64bit Windows 7):
* R v3.1.0 - seem to have both 32 and 64 bit available
* RStudio - v0.98.507 (32bit)
* Git 1.9.4

David is using the following  (in Mac 10.7.5):
* R v3.1.1
* RStudio - v0.98.507 (32bit)
* Git 1.9.4


### Week 1 Notes: 


### Week 2 Notes: 


### Week 3 Notes:  


### Assignment 1 notes:

I struggled with the first step of Assignment one, but found this document very useful! 
https://github.com/derekfranks/practice_assignment/blob/master/Practice_Assignment.pdf

### Assignment 2 notes: 

Flic: I found [this tutorial](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html) by Hadley Wickham (one of the pantheon of R gods) to be quite useful background for getting my head into the Lexical Scoping zone and thinking about environments and things, although it goes way past what this assignment requires when it describes the Lexical scoping and things!  But it's quite a useful resource anyway.

Flic: I also found the comments on the discussion board quite handy in helping me get my head around exactly what the means example was doing, which was @redrinkwater's handy tip!  For testing my finished functions, I found [this thread](https://class.coursera.org/rprog-006/forum/thread?thread_id=727) quite useful for some example calls to see if I got what I expected, since I wasn't quite clear on how the input worked at first.  [This one](https://class.coursera.org/rprog-006/forum/thread?thread_id=626) was also quite helpful on breaking down the example a little if you really can't fathom it.
